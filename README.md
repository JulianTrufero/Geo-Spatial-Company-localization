## GEO-SPATIAL LOCALIZATION PROYECT
- In this proyect, we will decide where to place the offices of a new company in the gaming industry. The company will have: 20 Designers, 5 UI/UX Engineers, 10 Frontend Developers, 15 Data Engineers, 5 Backend Developers, 20 Account Managers, 1 Maintenance guy that loves basketball, 10 Executives and 1 CEO/President.
- To define the best place for the company to grow, we focused on 6 different criteria out of all the company's employee preferences: account managers need to travel a lot, 30% of the company staff have at least 1 child, the CEO is vegan, executives like Starbucks A LOT, to make the maintenance guy happy, a basketball stadium must be around 10 Km and the office dogâ€”"Dobby" needs a hairdresser every month. 
- In order to place the new offices, we selected three specific locations as candidates: Palais Garnier area in Paris, France. CBD area in Melbourne, Australia and downtown Sao Paulo, Brazil. To make the final decision between them, we'll build a [Mongo DB](https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/) using an [API](https://foursquare.com/) with geographichal information about the venues that comply with the afordmentioned criteria. We'll make queries to the DB and build a score for each citiy based on distance information, and then select the city with the biggest score.
- All the analysis will be performed with the help of this libraries: [Json](https://www.json.org/json-en.html), [Folium](http://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs), [Pymongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
- The proyect is composed of two Python files and two Jupyter Notebooks
